 #        The strange Panda
In a zoo there was a **panda**. He was a peculiar panda. 
It is rumored that he can talk to the ghosts. 
One day he heard a voice saying, **"I have come to haunt you..."** 
***"Who is this?"*** Said the panda with a scared voice.
"It's your father,**Poh."** 
"What do you mean? This is not ***Kung Fu Panda***. I think you're in the wrong set." 
"Oh uh...bye!" 
Then the ghost faded.

"No i'm a bear that's painted black and white." He smirks. "Of course i'm a panda, you numnut!"
"Ok?" The ghost said.
The ghost then went inside his cage.
"What the hell are you doing?!"***Screamed the panda***.

***"I'm in the cage***," whispered the ghost and said ***"You remember, last time you asked me to help you to skip from this cage right?"*** so I am here to help you.

oh thank you so much, I was about to give up said the ***Panda***.
